# Definition of Ready(DoR)

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a set of criteria used in Agile project management and development, particularly within Scrum, to determine whether a user story or task is well-prepared and suitable for inclusion in an upcoming sprint or iteration.Below is our Definition of Ready:

1. Clear Requirements: The user story must have clear and detailed acceptance criteria that describe what needs to be achieved
2. Estimable: The development team should be able to estimate the effort required to complete the task
3. Dependencies Identified: Any dependencies on other tasks or resources should be identified and addressed
4. Prioritized: The user story should be prioritized in the product backlog, indicating its importance relative to others
5. Testable: There should be a clear understanding of how the feature will be tested, including any necessary test cases
