# Definition of Ready(DoR)

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a set of criteria used in Agile project management and development, particularly within Scrum, to determine whether a user story or task is well-prepared and suitable for inclusion in an upcoming sprint or iteration.Below is our Definition of Ready:

1. Clear Requirements: The user story must have clear and detailed acceptance criteria that describe what needs to be achieved
2. Estimable: The development team should be able to estimate the effort required to complete the task
3. Dependencies Identified: Any dependencies on other tasks or resources should be identified and addressed
4. Prioritized: The user story should be prioritized in the product backlog, indicating its importance relative to others
5. Testable: There should be a clear understanding of how the feature will be tested, including any necessary test cases

# Story Points Estimation

Story points serve as a metric to assess the effort required to complete a user story in our product backlog. To better organize the work to be performed, before each sprint, we evaluate our stories and the estimated effort for each one.

| Story Points | Effort Required     | Complexity      | Risk and Uncertainties |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 1            | Low                 | Low              | Low                    |
| 2            | Medium-Low          | Low              | Medium-Low             |
| 3            | Medium              | Medium           | Medium                 |
| 5            | Medium-High         | Medium-High      | High                   |
| 8            | High                | High             | High                   |
| 13           | Very High           | High             | Medium-High            |
| 21           | Extremely High      | Very High        | Extremely High         |
