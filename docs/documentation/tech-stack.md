# Tech Stack

Throughout the development of our gym management platform, we leveraged a variety of modern technologies to ensure efficiency, scalability, and a seamless user experience. Here is an overview of the tools and frameworks that were integral to the project:  

The **frontend** of the application was built using **Angular**, a powerful framework that allowed us to create an interactive and responsive user interface. For the **backend**, we utilized **Spring Boot** to develop robust and scalable RESTful APIs that served as the backbone of our application.  

To facilitate communication between microservices, we implemented **Apache Kafka**, ensuring reliable message exchange in a distributed environment. Additionally, **AWS** was chosen for the deployment of the application, providing a scalable and secure infrastructure to host the platform.  

To simulate secure and seamless payment processing, we integrated **Stripe**, enabling members to handle membership payments with ease. **Swagger** was employed to document our APIs, making them easily accessible and testable for both developers and stakeholders.  

The project was managed and organized using **Jira**, where tasks, user stories, and sprints were tracked efficiently. For version control, **GitHub** was utilized, allowing collaborative development and providing a central repository for the entire codebase.  

For communication within the team, we relied on **Discord**, a flexible platform that supported remote discussions, progress updates, and troubleshooting throughout the project lifecycle.
