# Definition of Done(DoD)

The Definition of Done (DoD) outlines the criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete. It ensures that all contributions to UA Smart Signage meet a consistent standard of quality and completeness. Below is our Definition of Done:

1. Code Completed: The development work has been finished, and all code has been written
2. Documentation Updated: Any relevant documentation (such as user manuals, API documentation, or technical notes) has been updated to reflect the changes made
3. Deployed to Production or Staging: The feature has been deployed to the production environment or, at the very least, to a staging environment for further evaluation
