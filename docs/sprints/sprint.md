To organize the tasks and ensure alignment, sprints were created, along with weekly (Sunday) meetings with the group to decide together what needed to be done and how the tasks would be distributed among the team members. Sprint reviews with the Software Engineering professors take place biweekly on Mondays, where the sprint's progress and outcomes are reviewed.

For each sprint review, the following elements are addressed:

- __Sprint Goal__: The objective of the sprint.
- __Responsible Team__: Including the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers.
- __User Stories__: The specific user stories being developed.
- __Sprint Retrospective__: A review of what went well, what could be improved, and how to enhance efficiency in the next sprint.
- __Sprint Burndown Chart__: A graphical representation of the remaining work versus time. It helps track the team's progress and predict whether the sprint goal will be achieved within the allotted time.


## Sprint 1 - 07/10/2024 - 13/10/2024
**Sprint Goal**

For the first sprint, the primary focus was to establish the foundational elements required for the project following the change in theme. This included:

1. __Business Model Canvas__: As the project theme was changed, it was necessary to create a new Business Model Canvas to align the business strategy with the development plan.

2. __Definition of Ready and Done__: Establishing clear definitions for "Ready" and "Done" to ensure all user stories meet specific criteria before entering and exiting the sprint workflow.

3. __Story Point Table__: Creating a points table to assign values to user stories, enabling better estimation and tracking of workload.

4. __Initial Website Prototype__: Developing a very basic homepage for the website, serving as a prototype for future design and functionality improvements.

5. __AWS Cognito Integration__: Implementing AWS Cognito for user authentication and login functionalities, laying the groundwork for secure access to the platform.
